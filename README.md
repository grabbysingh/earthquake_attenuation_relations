# earthquake_attenuation_relations
Designed and implemented a cutting edge advanced statistical model using three different models.
First model is Random Forest algorithm
Second model is K Nearest Neighbors
Third model is build using logistic regression.
Then compare the result of all these algorithm
Finally build a new model by combining all these three techniques together (Ensemble Technique), so that we can get a more accurate model for our research work.
